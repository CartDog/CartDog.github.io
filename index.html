        <h6>Posted: 1/24/19</h6>
        
        <p>Well my life is pretty cool I guess. I like to play hockey and go<br>
		four-wheeling. My entire family also rides four-wheelers. Both<br>
		my brothers have a four-wheeler and my parents have a side by
		<img src="SweetPicOfMe.jpg" alt="A Picture of me the editor" 
		width=500px, height=500px style="float:right"><br>
		side. I enjoy winter and summer equally, I like to play in the<br>
		snow, but I also enjoy go on trails in summer. My favorite class<br>
		is math and I do pretty good in it. I have a dog, two brothers,<br>
		and both my parents. We all play hockey except my dog,<br>
		obviously, and my mom. My one brother plays comp. and my other<br>
		brother is a mini-mite. Basically hockey is the best.</p>
        
        <h2 id="someFunnyStory">Some Funny Story</h2>
        <h6>Posted: 1/25/19</h6>
        
        <p>So... I guess at the time, the funniest thing I can think of is the<br>
		other day when my friends and I had to do lunch clean up duty. It's<br>
		funny because, we didn't actually do anything to deserve it. The people<br>
		we sit next to are slobs and create giant messes. The teachers just so<br>
		happen to see us at the table every day, so therefore, we had to clean<br>
		up. I personally found it annoying, but funny too. I mean they just picked us<br>
		because they see us there all the time and so they assumed it was us. In my<br>
		opinion, it's pretty funny. Some people are not that smart.</p>
        
		<h2 id="someRandomThing">Some Random Thing That Happened Today</h2>
        <h6>Posted: 1/25/19</h6>
        
        <p>Something random that happened today was one of my teachers questions. Me and my<br>
		friends we sitting eating lunch when the SRC(Detention) teacher comes over and<br>
		asked how many days we had to clean up lunch. There's nothing that significant about<br>
		it, but it was just random. It was random really only because we hadn't had to do<br>
		it in like two days, so I didn't know why he asked our table again. This leads to something<br>
		else that I did. So back to the thing I said about the whole lunch clean up thing.<br>
		Since we had to do that, we moved to a different table. We figured we could <br>
		prove to them that we were not the slobs. I think they just wanted us to be miserable<br>
		Honestly, I think if there was a mess again, they would still tell us to clean it up, you know because<br>
		our school is extremely fair.</p>

        <h6>Posted: 1/25/19</h6>
        
        <p>I just want to clarify something. This is really more of a diary since no one else will<br>
		probably even see it, so yeah. Well okay... self, that's all I had to say for today. Talk to<br>
		whoever whenever.</p>

        <p>Hey guys, just updating you, I'm doing some work on the website, so you can press the buttons at<br>
		the top, but they won't really do anything. Otherwise, I'm having a good day. Currently, it's just me and<br>
		my dad, so it's pretty lit. Okay, well peace out!</p>
